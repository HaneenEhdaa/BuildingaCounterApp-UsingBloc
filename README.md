# Counter App with Flutter Bloc

This project demonstrates the usage of the **Flutter Bloc** architecture to manage state in a Flutter application. It includes examples of `BlocBuilder`, `BlocListener`, and `BlocConsumer` with a **Counter App** and a **Theme Toggle** feature.

## Problem Statement:
Title: Create two different BLoCs
- A CounterBloc to handle integer value
- A ThemeBloc to toggle between light and dark themes.


## Project Features

### Counter App:
- **Increment and Decrement Buttons** to manage the counter.
- **State Management** with `BlocBuilder`, `BlocConsumer`, and `BlocListener`.
- Displays a notification SnackBar when the counter reaches certain values (e.g., 3, -10 or 10).

### Theme Toggle:
- Light and Dark theme switcher using the **Theme Bloc**.
- Dynamic UI updates based on the current theme.
